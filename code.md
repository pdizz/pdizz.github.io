## Bin-packing for School Pictures

Bin packing algorithm derived from [github.com/jakesgordon/bin-packing](https://github.com/jakesgordon/bin-packing) and 
adapted to pack to multiple growing bins with a fixed maximum size.

This algorithm will pack multiple images to fit on variable-length sheets printed on roll-paper. 
It is used in printing school picture packages e.g. a sheet of wallets. Because the length of the sheets varies the 
size of the "bin" or sheet must grow to fit the images as they're added without wasting extra space or requiring the 
paper to be cut by hand.
