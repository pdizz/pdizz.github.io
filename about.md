I am a geek, a programmer, a gamer, a media junkie, and an outdoor enthusiast. I love programming and the power 
it gives me to create something from nothing. 

When I'm not in the office I love to get outdoors and hit the trail. I've written some of my best code in my head while 
walking my dog. I like kayaking and mountain biking, and I enjoy the mental and physical challenge of archery and 
marksmanship. Whether it's new technologies or new trails I'm always exploring.
