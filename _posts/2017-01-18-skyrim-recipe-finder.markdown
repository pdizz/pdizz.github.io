Wanting to brush up on some of the latest developments in the Javascript world, I've decided to revive one
of my first pet projects, my Skyrim alchemy recipe finder. I've heard Vue.js described as like React, a reactive 
framework with a virtual DOM, but with a lower barrier of entry, and thought it would be a good fit for a project this 
small.

My first use-case was I wanted a way to pick a few ingredients in my inventory, and quickly see any other ingredients 
that might match. I also wanted to display possible recipes for any selected ingredients.
